# Better Paste
Obsidian plugin which improves pasting images by allowing the user to rename pasted images.
## Note
There is an odd bug where if you rename the file too fast, the file will get renamed, but the corresponding links to the file will not.  
I'm unsure on how to fix this, but for the time being, **please don't rename too fast**.  
As soon as I discover a good solution for this, I'll update the plugin.
## Usage
Upon enabling the plugin, whenever the user pasts an image, you are then prompted to rename the file to something more understandable, as opposed to the default behavior of Obsidian.  
Within the settings of the plugin, you can resolve conflicing names by replacing them.
## Credit
I realize that this plugin already exists, however, I found that plugin to be too overkill for my usage.  
However, I did read the code to help develop this, since (in my opinion), the Obsidian API can be very lacking at times.
